Gold Prices up 2.94% So Far This Week

Dear Iggy, 

 

As worries about the contagion of the fallout of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the Signature Bank and Silvergate have intensified, investors are now facing increasing risk in Europe with doubts about the health of the popular Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, which has supported Gold prices and is up 2.94% so far this week, at around $1,921 an ounce.

Chart
Remember that Gold is a commodity historically considered a safe-haven asset, often sought during uncertain and volatile times in a process known as “flight to quality”. The precious metal is likely to continue rising if the situation doesn’t improve.
