Buy a Diesel Tablet
We’ve been telling you about our limited time opportunity to get a Diesel Tablet AND 5 free online training courses… 

Well, time is almost up. We’re running out of Special Offer Diesel Tablets and when they’re gone so is your chance to get in on these online training courses:

Aftertreatment Systems
Emissions Systems Overview
Heating & Air Conditioning
Intro to Electrical
Service, Safety, Shop Equipment, & the EPA
Don’t miss your last chance to get direct access to all five when you buy the Diesel Tablet.

Far and away one of our most popular products, the Diesel Tablet lets you read and clear fault codes, monitor live data, AND perform all emission system-related commands on the EGR, DPF, and SCR systems for every commercial truck in the USA and Canada.

When you buy the Diesel Tablet, you not only get the 5 online training courses, but every Tablet comes with a year of automatic updates, USA based tech support, and 12 months of Diesel Repair Standard.

Best of all, the Diesel Tablet is perpetual license software, which means it’s guaranteed to do the job and never expire… but the same can’t be said about these online training classes. They end 3/31.
