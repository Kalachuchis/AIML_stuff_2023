Dear Pointwesters,

 

With much regret, I am announcing Roxanne Pilotonâ€™s resignation as Business Unit Head for Banking and Financial Services (MC3), which shall take effect on April 30, 2022.  Rox has been with us for 18 years and has been invaluable in helping guide the organization through our various transformations. She is well-known for her can-do attitude, and is often asked to take on difficult responsibilities.  She is well-loved by the people that she has worked with, and she has consistently shown genuine concern for her team.  She will further her passion for people development as she pursues her advocacy on humanitarian causes, particularly in helping underprivileged children. We are very thankful for the contributions Rox has made to Pointwest over the years.



 




I would also like to introduce you all to Teresa Tamayo who has joined us on March 1, 2022. Tere will be taking over the reins of MC3 from Rox, and will likewise lead the BA Center of Excellence.  Tere comes with two decades of IT consultancy, operations, and program and project management experience.  She has worked all over the Philippines as well as around the globe, most recently returning from a stint in Iraq.  She has worked both in the private sector and public sector, including engagements with Indra Philippines, Millennium Challenge Account-Philippines, Development Alternatives, Inc./USAID, and has consulted for the World Bank, ADB, and the International Finance Corporation, among others.  We look forward to her contributions to Pointwest as she comes on board.

 

As we wish Rox all the best in her new endeavor, I enjoin everyone to extend your warmest welcome to Tere as she joins us in the Pointwest family.

 

Sincerely,

 

REU
