Hi Ramon,

Congratulations for passing the Programmer's Aptitude Test!
We are now down to proceed with the next assessment which is the Talegent Exam composed of four parts.
Fault Finding
Logical Reasoning
Verbal Reasoning
Personality Exam
Please take note that how fast and how accurate you answer is being recorded by the system. We prohibit the use of calculators and browsing of the internet.

Once you're done, we will automatically receive the result from our system. If you pass this examination, we will schedule a phone interview to know more about your skills and how passionate and interested you are for the Full Stack bootcamp.

Passing the exams and initial interview will then lead you to have the Final Interview with our Full Stack Developers. Once you passed their assessment we would proceed to endorsing your profile to the Head of Application and Modernization Group for the review and proceed with the Job Offer. These steps usually happen on separate days.
