Hey Iggy,

This is a friendly reminder that the early bird price for my React course, React 18 for Beginners, ends soon and the price will go up to $149 after. This is your last chance to enroll at a highly discounted price.

If you're a beginner who wants to learn React from scratch and build real-world apps or a React developer who wants to fill in the gaps in your knowledge, this course is for you.

I've poured my heart and soul into this course, and I'm confident it'll take your React skills to the next level. I haven't come across any other courses that cover React with TypeScript using the latest tools and techniques with such clarity. Trust me, you won't find anything like it elsewhere!

You'll get:
8 hours of video
140 lessons
Exercises and solutions
Real-world production-grade project
Summary notes and cheat sheets
Little-known expert tips

Please note that this course is an entirely separate course from my old React course and it will not be available for free to those who purchased the old one. However, you can still take advantage of the special early bird price to enroll.

The course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try it risk free! If you're not satisfied, simply ask for a refund.

Don't miss this opportunity to get this amazing course with a huge discount!
