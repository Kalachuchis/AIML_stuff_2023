Gather and
the Metaverse
It's been over a year since we first began building Gather, and our mission remains the same: to build a platform that makes virtual interactions more human.
Whether you're collaborating with co-workers or just hanging out with friends, we want to make spending time with your communities just as rewarding as real life. To do this well, we are building a Metaverse full of normal people doing things of real value. The Metaverse isn't some far-off sci-fi concept â€” it's happening now and has already provided all this concrete value.
Here at Gather we're building a community of people who believe that the Metaverse should be open and accessible to all. That's why to access Gather all you need is a device and internet connection. Just a link, a couple clicks, and you're in. No download, no sign-ups required.
Thanks for being part of our journey.
