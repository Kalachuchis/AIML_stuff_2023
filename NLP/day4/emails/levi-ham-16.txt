Hi Pointwesters!
With the pace of change increasing and with no end in sight, teams and organizations need to learn how to work nimbly on a daily basis. Agility is not simply a state of mind; it is a way of working. Learning professionals have the opportunity to help leaders, teams, and individual performers become more flexible and responsive. Renowned Agile Coach Ian Pestelos will share an hour about his views on being agile at work, especially in a new normal environment.
