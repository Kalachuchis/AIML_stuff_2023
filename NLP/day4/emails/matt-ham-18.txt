Hi All,

Good day!

Hope you all are doing well.

In line with the preparation of the Facilities Management Team for next year, we would like to request you to empty and surrender your lockers. But, should you need storage for your belongings, in the event that you'll be asked to report on site from time to time, you may raise a ticket requesting for a pedestal.

Please reach out to regarding this matter.

Thank you. And have a great day ahead.
