* Time Series Analysis

** Time Series Analysis with Pandas

*** Datetime library

#+NAME: SUBMODULES_DATETIME

| datetime    | setting of date *Args(year,date,month) |
| timedelta   | change of date                         |
| to_datetime | convert string to date                 |

1. datetime
   - seting of date
   - ARGS: year, date, month
2. timedelta
   - difference of date
3. to_datetime
   - convert string to date


*** Pandas Functions

1. *Resampling*
   - alter aggregation levels
   - changes time interval if current interval has missing values
2. *Shifting*
   - index + 1 or - 1 to next column using same data
     | 1 | na | na |
     | 2 |  1 | na |
     | 3 |  2 | 1  |
   - used for forecasting
    
3. *Rolling*
   #+begin_src python
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
   rolling(3).sum()
   # would iterate by 3
   [(1+2+3), (2+3+4), ..]
   #+end_src
   you can use sum, mean, etc
   to smooth out a graph
   

** TIme Series Decomposition

PARTS:
- Trend -> long term invrease or decrease in the data
  + uses rolling function
- Seasonality -> refers to regular patterns in the data that occurs at
  + DETREND THE DATA: trend - actual data (ADDITIVE)
  + group by month then get average 
- Noise/Resiudal -> random variation in data
  + detrended - seasonality

:
- additive
- multiplicative


  
** Anomaly Detection and Forecasting - Statistical Techniques
- (Simple) Moving Average
  + getting the general trend of the data set
  + to get a smoother plot
  + (1/k)
- Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
  - a(point[n]) + (1-a)EWMA[n-1]
  - anomaly are detected using standard deviation from current point
*** Forecasting
Predicting future behavior using past and present events
- Autoregressive Models
- Moving Average Models
- ARMA 
- ARIMA
- SARIMA
